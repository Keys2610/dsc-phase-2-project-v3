We can say with confidence that movies lasting between 1 to 1.5 hours are the most recommended in terms of length

### Directors
Based on current box office trends, we recommend producing movies directed by either Tod Williams or William Bell, both of which specialize in "found-film horror"

### Genres
The studio should focus on producing horror, mystery, and/or thriller movies to maximize their profit to production cost ratio. The studio should avoid making crime movies as they have the worst profit to production cost ratio compared to other genres.
